NOTE:

We are temporarily using a custom version of the tc-maven-plugin, due to a bug in the
released versions that causes the maven lifecycle to be forked, and the unit tests run,
many times during a build.  Before you can run the AtomServer build, you must:

1)  unzip the tc-maven-plugin.tgz tarball
2)  cd into the tc-maven-plugin project directory
3)  run "mvn install" to build the custom version and install it into your local repo

after that, the AtomServer build will work properly.  As soon as we can get official 
resolution from the Terracotta folks, we will remove the custom source and re-set the 
plugin version in the AtomServer POM to an official released version.
