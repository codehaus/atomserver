            <ol>
                <li>Added a "throttled" AtomServer. This AtomServer throttles all PUTs, POSTs, and DELETEs
                    using a ThreadPool front-ended with a Blocking Queue. When all Threads in the Pool are in use,
                    incoming requests are queued up. The theory is that, because we serialize all writes to the DB,
                    when it is overloaded its performance degrades significantly, and that by throttling DB input
                    to some optimum threshold we can maximize performance. This theory was proven out in
                    performance testing. We saw a 220% decrease in average response time for PUTs for
                    the throttled AtomServer, with a relatively constant TPM, and smooth behavior.
                    In contrast the "normal" AtomServer saw spiky behavior, and significant performance degradation.

                <li>Aggregate Feeds were completely rewritten.</li>
                <li>Added "sharded paths" file-based ContentStorage. </li>
                <li>Gzipping for file-based ContentStorage.</li>
                <li>Cleaned up the Junits significantly. The tests no longer use a local "var" directory. </li>
                <li>Google Analytics for the site</li>
            </ol>

        <section name="Release 2.0 (5/13/08)">
            <ol>
                <li>This is the initial open source release.
                It is numbered 2.0 because the code behind AtomServer has been around
                as an internal application for about 1 year, and over that time went through many revisions</li>
